Items to do/consider in pyramid port


- example controller to document port
    - formalchemy processing
    - no duplication on model/view validation
    - pyramid_formalchemy (aka admin interface) integration
    - inheritance from a base crud class
- Authentication system
    - Either new and limit interoperability in the port
    - or re-implement authKit for compatability with zkpylons (although may be outdated)
    - figure out a way for legacy to share a session(id)
- Templates/Theme inheritance similar to legacy zkpylons
    - New templating engine
    - Focus on neat, consistent templates
    - Reduce repetition in form generation and error reporting
